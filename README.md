### SNEAK ATTACK

I created the stealth and sneak attack mechanic.
When encountering an enemy, a stealth check is performed and if successful, the rogue can perform a sneak attack on the first attack.
Stealth validation is done for all characters, but does not generate the possibility of sneak attack.
